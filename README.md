# Development Guidelines
- Keep in mind that we will use a linter to keep track of our coding style to avoid messy spaghetti codes 
- We will use AirBnB style https://dev.to/bzvyagintsev/migrate-angular-app-to-eslint-with-prettier-airbnb-styleguide-husky-and-lint-staged-862
- Whenever a new package is installed please write it on the PR so that others are noticed to run `npm install`
- Please request any member to review your code before merging to develop
- When develop is tested by QA, only then it will be merged to master

## Flow

2. Ask your peer & QA to review your code
3. If there are comments, please resovle them before merging to **develop**
